Initial thoughts on how to build this
=======================================

#### Motor rpm

Target ~ 2500 rpm/ 41 Hz

Assume 30-50 RPM on pedals => 0.5 - 0.8 Hz

Therefore need 60:1 or 80:1 gearing.

Aim for 60:1

Initial best is 4.5:1 :(

  Aim for an additional 20:1 (goes to ~85:1)

  With pulley:

  700mm dia wheel want 35mm bottom pulley : )
